## #1 Topic
I want to design a map that explores emigration from Augusta, Sicily in the late 19th-early 20th century. Recently, I have been doing some genealogy research in advance of a trip to Sicily this summer. My maternal grandmother’s parents were born in Augusta, Sicily, a town on the eastern coast near Syracuse that was founded in 1232. Like all of Sicily, many people left during this time period in search of a better life, including my great-grandparents, who entered through Ellis Island and settled in Detroit and several of their extended family members.
## #2 Question
because I want to find out where those that left Augusta settled. When we asked my grandma about any potential cousins in Sicily, she always told us that everyone left!
## #3 Motivation
in order to help the map user or audience understand better emigration patterns through the example of a town in Sicily.

## Data
Through Steve Morse’s [Ellis Island search](https://stevemorse.org/ellis2/ellisgold.html?first_kind=1&FNM=&kind=close&LNM=), I could find all the passengers who listed Augusta as their residence. This file is data/ellis_augusta.csv  
That index only gives me their arrival date and ship name, though.  
Both Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org have the digitized manifests for Ellis Island and some other ports of entry for the US. I don’t know how I can get the data I want, namely the Final Destination listed on the manifest for the passengers pulled from above without manually searching. I am still looking around for a different tool/database for this step. If I can’t get this info, I will have to rethink the project, maybe focusing on dates instead.
